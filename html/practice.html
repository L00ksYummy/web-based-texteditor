    <p> When making a paragraph, you can add br or a break <br> to skip to the next line in a paragraph </p>
    <p> Here <br> I am using <br> constant breaks<br> to demonstrate <br> what it does</p>
    <p> you cannot skip a line a paragraph without adding those break statements. </p>
    <pre>
        If you use the "pre" statement 
        It stands for preformat
        It allows us to add breaks in a sentence without
        Having to use the br statement
        It saves every detail of the paragraph
        This includes the font, the indents from the code, and the breaks in the line!
